# Development Workflow

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](mdc:http:/localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Key Scripts

The following scripts are available in [package.json](mdc:package.json):

- `pnpm dev` - Start the development server with Turbopack
- `pnpm build` - Build the application for production
- `pnpm start` - Start the production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## Adding New Components

1. For shadcn/ui components, use the CLI:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
   ```

2. Custom components should be added to the appropriate directory:
   - UI components: [components/ui/](mdc:components/ui)
   - Page-specific components: Create in the respective page directory
   - Shared components: Create in [components/](mdc:components)

## Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the Next.js App Router patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use utility functions from [lib/utils.ts](mdc:lib/utils.ts) for common operations
